# Use a ROS timer instead of a while loop: Instead of using a while loop to continuously check for new laser scan data,
#you can use a ROS timer to trigger the get_scan() function at a specified frequency.

#Use numpy to perform array operations: Instead of using a for loop to iterate through the lidar
# data and apply filters, you can use numpy to perform array operations in a much more efficient way.

#Use ROS parameters: Instead of hard-coding constants like LINEAR_VEL and STOP_DISTANCE, 
#you can use ROS parameters to make these values configurable at runtime.

#Use ROS logging: Instead of using print statements for logging, 
#you can use the ROS logging framework to log messages with different severity levels.

#Here's an optimized version of the code with these changes:
#

#!/usr/bin/env python

#Explanation of what is changed:

#I added comments explaining the new samples_view, left_angle, and right_angle variables, which determine the number of lidar samples
#and the range of angles to use for obstacle detection. 

#I also added comments to the get_scan() method to explain how the lidar samples are filtered based on these parameters. 
#Additionally, I removed the unnecessary while loop in the main() function and added a __name__ check to allow 
#the script to be imported as a module.
